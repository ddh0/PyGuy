# About that code...
PyGuy Alpha was written before I had a knowledge of Python's PEP guidelines, and is a poor excuse for entertainment. It's more of an exercise in learning Pygame than a playable game.

Again, the code here is messy and unorganized, and I've learned so much since this was written. I leave this here so I can come back and see how much I've learned over time.
