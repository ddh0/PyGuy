# PyGuy
A boundary-breaking PC platformer, written in Python 3.8 and still very early in development.

# What is PyGuy?
PyGuy is a PC platformer developed solely by me (Dylan Halladay), and it's designed to challenge your ability to think out of the box. Each level includes a puzzle that you must solve in order to gain new abilities and progress in the story.

# How do I play it?
Download PyGuy.py (the filename differs based on the version) as well as the /resources/ folder. Keep the original folder structure. After you have it all downloaded, just run PyGuy.py. Note that you need to install pygame, if you don't have it already.

Have fun! Open an issue if you find something's wrong.

# When will PyGuy be done?
Whenever I feel PyGuy is complete and clean. I'm not keen on releasing unpolished work stamped with my name.
